\section{Problem}
For my CSE 841 Project, I am interested in pursuing methods of calculating semantic similarity in short texts. Short texts in particular being a constrained problem where traditional larger document comparison methods underperform\cite{SemanticSimilarity}. I want to apply and compare a variety of methods for semantic comparison between short sentences, including traditional methods, but with a primary focus on word embeddings discussed in recent literature\cite{ShortTextWord}. It is my belief that this is a reasonably approachable topic with a wide breadth of literature and is suitable for a course project. I plan on using existing implementations for word embeddings (e.g. word2vec) and for some of the resulting text similarity calculations.

\section{Data}
I plan on performing my evaluation on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus \cite{MSRParaphrase}. This will involve a process of thresholding similarity comparisons to classify whether or not short descriptions are paraphrases of one another. I may also possibly work with a similar corpus collected from Twitter data\cite{Twitter}.
